# Sensor-Calibration
Camera Calibration with OpenCV. This project demonstrates camera calibration using OpenCV inside Google Colab, leveraging a webcam connected through a JavaScript–Python bridge. The calibration process estimates the camera’s intrinsic parameters by capturing multiple images of a known calibration pattern—a printed chessboard grid.
